Alternative User Interface
Includes voicecommand, download, playvideo, and textcommand scripts

this Requires boost, curl, xterm, espeak, and some other things
If you don't have dependencies installed (you may need to find a different version of boost)
try running sudo apt-get install libboost1.50-dev libboost-regex1.50-dev youtube-dl axel curl xterm libcurl4-openssl-dev mpg123 flac

To install:
cd Install; ./InstallAUISuite.sh

It will ask you if you want to install the dependencies and then will ask to install each script.
